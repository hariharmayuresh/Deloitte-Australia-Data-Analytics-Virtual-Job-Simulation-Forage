## Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation – Forage

📊 Data-Driven Insights for Manufacturing Downtime Optimization

This project is part of a virtual job simulation offered by Deloitte Australia through Forage, completed in February 2025. The task involved analyzing real-world telemetry data from four global manufacturing plants to uncover patterns in machine downtime using Tableau.


## 🚀 Project Summary

Using machine telemetry data from Daikibo’s four international factories, this project aims to identify:
- 1.	Which factory had the highest machine downtime
- 2.	Which machine types broke down most frequently in that factory

To uncover these insights, a calculated metric called “Unhealthy” was created, quantifying 10-minute downtime intervals per unhealthy status. The analysis was visualized using interactive dashboards in Tableau.



## 📍 Factory Locations Analyzed
- 🏭 Meiyo – Tokyo, Japan
- 🏭 Seiko – Osaka, Japan
- 🏭 Berlin – Berlin, Germany
- 🏭 Shenzhen – Shenzhen, China

Each site hosted 9 types of machines transmitting telemetry every 10 minutes during May 2021.
